  Reads and records DevDigest's curated engineering insights. Use at the START of

  specificity bar an entry must clear, and the duplicate check that runs before
  writing. Triggers: "insights", "INSIGHTS.md", "wrap up", "what did we learn",

  which something non-obvious was discovered.

# engineering-insights

A two-half loop over the `INSIGHTS.md` files. **Read** at the start of a task,
**record** at the end. Insights are module-local by design: a session working in
`client/` reads `client/INSIGHTS.md`, not all five. Knowledge lives next to the
code it is about.

## Step 1 — Read first (mandatory)

Before answering a question or touching code:

1. Resolve the module from the request using the table below.
2. Read that `INSIGHTS.md` in full. It is capped and short — read it, don't grep.
3. Read the root `INSIGHTS.md` as well when the work spans two or more packages.
4. **Say in one line which file you read and whether it was relevant.** Example:
   `Read server/INSIGHTS.md — nothing on SSE.` A silent read gets skipped; the
   sentence is what makes it real.

If a curated file answers the question, cite it instead of re-deriving from
code. This is the order root `CLAUDE.md` already sets out: `specs/` → `docs/` →
`INSIGHTS.md` → source.

## Module resolution

| The work touches                                                            | File                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `server/**`, including `src/modules/repo-intel/**`                           | `server/INSIGHTS.md`        |
| `client/**`                                                                  | `client/INSIGHTS.md`        |
| `reviewer-core/**`                                                           | `reviewer-core/INSIGHTS.md` |
| `e2e/**`, `scripts/e2e.sh`                                                   | `e2e/INSIGHTS.md`           |
| `scripts/`, `.github/`, `docker-compose.yml`, root docs, **or ≥2 packages**  | `INSIGHTS.md` (root)        |

Edge cases that get misfiled:

- **`server/src/vendor/shared/**` → root.** That is `@devdigest/shared`; a
  contract change there reaches every package, so it is never server-local.
- **`server/src/modules/repo-intel/` → `server/`.** It is a folder inside
  `@devdigest/api`, not a package of its own.
- **`client/src/vendor/**` → `client/`,** and only for insights about *consuming*
  it. The vendored code itself is not ours to change.
- A finding about the workflow itself (CI, `dev.sh`, package managers) → root.

## Step 2 — Record last (conditional)

### 2a. Gate — is there anything to record?

Judge the session by feel, not by counting. A typo, a rename, a routine feature
that went exactly as expected → **write nothing, say "nothing worth recording",
stop.** Recording noise is worse than recording nothing.

If something non-obvious did happen, collect candidates and rank them — highest
signal first:

1. **User corrections** — an explicit "no, do it this way". Highest signal there
   is; the repo was wrong or the agent's default was wrong.
2. **Approaches that failed** — what was tried and abandoned, and why.
3. **Repeated friction** — the same error or workaround hit more than once.
4. **Conventions discovered by reading code** — things `CLAUDE.md` doesn't say.
5. **Dependency and toolchain quirks.**

**Cap at 3 entries per session**, even when more candidates exist. If everything
looks worth writing, the bar is being applied too loosely.

### 2b. Write

For each surviving candidate:

1. **Read the target file** before writing it.
2. **Check for a duplicate** — `grep -i '<key identifier>' <module>/INSIGHTS.md`.
   If a near-duplicate is there, **refine that entry** — sharpen the claim,
   update the date, add the evidence — instead of appending a near-copy.
3. **Append** under the right section, newest first within that section.
4. If an entry contradicts an existing one, do **not** write both. Correct the
   old one and note what changed.

Never delete an entry that still holds. When something an entry warns about gets
fixed in code, don't delete it either — mark it, so the next reader knows the
warning is historical:

```markdown
- **2026-07-31** — … original claim … **Fixed 2026-08-14 in `server/src/…`.**
```

### 2c. Report

One line per action, then stop. No trailing commentary.

```
server/INSIGHTS.md — added under What Doesn't Work: 422 on empty body …
Skipped: grounding-gate note (already covered by the 2026-07-31 entry)
```

## Which section

| Section                    | What belongs there                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Decisions`                | A choice made, with the alternative that was rejected        |
| `What Works`               | An approach that solved something and should be reused       |
| `What Doesn't Work`        | A dead end — the section most often skipped, and the most valuable |
| `Codebase Patterns`        | A convention you had to discover by reading the code         |
| `Tool & Library Notes`     | A quirk of a dependency, CLI, or the toolchain               |
| `Recurring Errors & Fixes` | A symptom you will hit again, and its cause                  |
| `Open Questions`           | Something left unresolved, so the next session knows          |

## Entry format

`Decisions` keeps the existing three-line prose form:

```markdown
### 2026-07-31 — Mechanical grounding gate, not a trusted model

**What:** the decision, in one sentence.
**Why:** the constraint that forced it.
**Rejected:** what was tried, and how it failed.
```

Every other section takes a dated bullet — claim first, evidence last:

```markdown
- **2026-07-31** — plain `npm test` in `e2e/` fails flows 02/04/05 against the
  dev DB: flow 02 follows the home redirect to the *first* repo and a dev DB has
  several. Use `npm run e2e:hermetic`. `e2e/specs/02-repo-overview.flow.json`
```

House style: hard-wrap at ~79 columns, backtick every path and identifier, quote
the **actual** error string, and end with a `path:line` or a runnable command
wherever one exists.

## The bar

An entry must be actionable **cold** — the next session reads it and knows what
to do without re-deriving anything.

| ✗ Noise                      | ✓ Insight                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "e2e tests can be flaky"     | "flows assume exactly one seeded repo — flow 02 follows the home redirect to the *first* one, so the dev DB fails 02/04/05; use `npm run e2e:hermetic`" |
| "be careful with migrations" | "`relation … does not exist` on a fresh clone means migrations were skipped — they do not run on boot. `cd server && pnpm db:migrate`"               |
| "Promises can be tricky"     | "`Promise.all()` over the ingest pipeline times out past ~30 items — use `Promise.allSettled()` in batches of 10"                                    |

**The test: if it would be obvious to anyone reading the code, don't write it.**
Generic advice is the failure mode — "use async carefully" is true everywhere and
therefore useful nowhere.

## Keeping the files lean

- Roughly **5 entries per section**. Past that, signal drops.
- When an entry becomes stable reference material, **promote it into
  `<module>/docs/` and delete it here.** That path is what keeps these short.
- An entry that no longer holds is worse than no entry. Correct or mark it.

## Anti-patterns

- Writing an entry because the session was long, rather than because something
  was learned.
- A title instead of content — "fixed the SSE bug" tells the next session
  nothing. Write the claim, not the label.
- Filing everything under `What Works`.
- Appending a fifth variation of an entry that already exists.
- Recording what `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, or `docs/` already says.

## What this skill does not do

It captures insights only. It does not review code, write documentation, update
`specs/`, or run tests. `INSIGHTS.md` is not a session diary — it holds durable
findings, not a record of what happened.
